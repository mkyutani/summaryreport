# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is currently empty aside from this guide. There is no established source, test, or asset layout yet. When adding code, prefer a conventional structure such as:
- `src/` for application or library code.
- `tests/` for automated tests.
- `assets/` for static files (data, images, fixtures).

If you introduce a new top-level directory, document its purpose here.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
No build or test commands are defined yet. Once tooling is added, document the canonical commands here with examples, e.g.:
- `npm run build` to produce distributable artifacts.
- `pytest` to run the test suite.
- `make dev` to run a local development server.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Style rules are not established. When you introduce a language or framework, add the relevant conventions. At a minimum, document:
- Indentation and formatting rules (e.g., 2 vs 4 spaces).
- Naming patterns (e.g., `snake_case` for Python modules, `PascalCase` for classes).
- Formatting or linting tools (e.g., `black`, `prettier`, `eslint`) and how to run them.

## Testing Guidelines
No testing framework is selected. When tests are added, specify:
- The framework and its configuration location.
- Test naming patterns (e.g., `test_*.py`, `*.spec.ts`).
- How to run the suite and any coverage expectations.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
There is no commit history to infer conventions. Until standards are defined:
- Use concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add initial scaffold").
- Include a clear PR description and link relevant issues.
- Provide screenshots for UI changes and reproduction steps for bugs.

## Agent-Specific Instructions
If you add automation, scripts, or agent workflows, document them here and keep instructions task-focused and reproducible.
